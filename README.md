## Overview
This project aims to transform the abstract concept of automotive luxury into a measurable index called the **Luxury Score**. By engineering meaningful features and employing clustering techniques, the analysis provides insights into market segmentation, aiding car brands in strategic positioning.

## Business Insights and Impacts
### Key Implications:
1. **Luxury Score Utility**: 
   - Provides automakers with a quantitative measure of luxury, enabling benchmarking against competitors.
   - Helps identify areas for improvement in design, performance, or branding.

2. **Cluster-Based Marketing**:
   - **Cluster 1 (Mid-Range Practical Cars)**: Focus marketing efforts on reliability, balanced performance, and affordability.
   - **Cluster 2 (High-Performance Luxury Cars)**: Highlight advanced engine technology, size, and luxury branding to appeal to premium buyers.
   - **Cluster 3 (Economical Compact Cars)**: Emphasize fuel efficiency, practicality, and low cost to attract budget-conscious consumers.

3. **Strategic Product Development**:
   - Use insights from feature importance to refine existing models or design new ones tailored to customer preferences.
   - Enhance the perception of luxury by improving features like size, performance, and brand reputation.

4. **Market Positioning**:
   - Automotive brands can adjust their positioning strategies based on the clusters and their luxury scores to align with target demographics.

5. **Customer Insights**:
   - Empower customers with data-driven recommendations to select cars based on their priorities, such as performance, luxury, or cost-effectiveness.

## Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Quantify automotive luxury by calculating a composite score based on key vehicle attributes.
- **Secondary Goal**: Identify natural groupings among car models to guide market segmentation and product strategy.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on 193 car models, with 39 features including:
- **Numerical Features**: Horsepower, engine size, curb weight, etc.
- **Categorical Features**: Make, fuel type, number of doors, etc.

### Key Engineered Features:
1. **Power-to-Weight Ratio**: Reflects performance relative to car weight.
2. **Size Index**: Captures the overall dimensions of the car.
3. **Luxury Brand Indicator**: Binary indicator for brands like Jaguar, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.
4. **Fuel Economy Difference**: Highway MPG - City MPG.
5. **Performance Index**: Combines engine size, compression ratio, and peak RPM.
6. **Weight-to-Size Ratio**: Relates car weight to its dimensions.
7. **Compression Efficiency**: Balances compression ratio, horsepower, and engine size.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing values and redundant features.
- Standardized numerical features and normalized engineered metrics.
- Encoded categorical variables (e.g., fuel type) into dummy variables.

### 2. Luxury Score Construction
- Combined top features identified through **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models.
- Weighted features based on their average importance across both models.
- Normalized feature values to compute a **Luxury Score** for each car.

### 3. Clustering Analysis
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to segment cars into three distinct clusters.
- Used silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Clusters included:
  - **Cluster 1**: Mid-Range Practical Cars
  - **Cluster 2**: High-Performance Luxury Cars
  - **Cluster 3**: Economical Compact Cars

## Repository Structure
- **`Automobile.R`**: R script containing the complete analysis, from data preprocessing to clustering.
- **`Dataset5_Automobile_data.csv`**: The cleaned and preprocessed dataset used for analysis.
- **`Final_Wan.pdf`**: A detailed report summarizing the project methodology, results, and business insights.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate additional datasets for better model robustness (e.g., sales data).
- Explore advanced clustering techniques like hierarchical clustering.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time luxury score visualization.
